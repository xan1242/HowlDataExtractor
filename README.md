# HowlDataExtractor
Tool for extracting NDI HOWL files used in Crash Team Racing

Help is wanted to get this format dissected properly!  :)

Check out CTR HOWL info.md!

# HowlSeq2Midi
You can use this tool to convert the sequence packs extracted by the HowlDataExtractor to MIDI!

Be warned, this tool is still unfinished!

## TODO
- It currently only extracts the offset tables and sequence packs.
- Add documentation of the file format
- Reverse more of the format
