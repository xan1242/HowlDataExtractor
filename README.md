# HowlDataExtractor
Tool for extracting NDI HOWL files used in Crash Team Racing

Help is wanted to get this format dissected properly!  :)

Check out CTR HOWL info.md!

# HowlSeq2Midi
You can use this tool to convert the sequence packs extracted by the HowlDataExtractor to MIDI!

Be warned, this tool is still unfinished!

## TODO
- It currently only extracts the offset tables and sequence packs.
- Add documentation of the file format
- Reverse more of the format
- Sample pack extraction
- Repacking

# Demos
Here's a demonstration what you can achieve with these tools:

# MIDI conversions
I've decided to put my conversions here in this repo as well! Most of them are made specifically to be played on a Roland SC-VA (SC-8850 compatible)

Note that some aren't finished (particularly Crash Cove).

You'll find MIDI files and Cakewalk project files in respective folders inside "MIDI conversions"!
